"""Crash-safe rental ledger — what the provisioner owns, on disk, at all times.

The one unforgivable failure mode for a provisioner is the **leaked pod**: a
box that keeps billing after the process that rented it died. The defence is a
write-ahead ledger: every instance is recorded here (atomically, tmp + rename)
the moment it is launched, *before* anything else happens to it, so a restart
can always resume teardown from disk. The complement is :func:`reconcile`,
which catches the opposite hole — a pod the provider created but whose record
we failed to write (crash between the API call and the save): anything live
and tagged ``cascade-`` that the ledger does not own is an orphan to kill.

Everything here is pure functions over plain data plus two tiny I/O helpers
(:func:`load_state` / :func:`save_state`); time enters only as caller-supplied
ISO strings, so tests inject their own clock.
