"""King-of-the-hill decision: does the challenger dethrone the king?

A round compares two trained models — the king's and the challenger's — scored
on the *same* eval windows (see :mod:`.scoring`). The decision is a paired
bootstrap LCB on the relative geomean(CRPS, MASE) improvement of challenger
over king. The challenger *wins the round* iff that LCB clears the win margin
and there are enough common windows to make the call.

Dethroning is deliberately sticky: the validator requires ``dethrone_cp``
consecutive round wins before the throne actually changes hands (the
consecutive-win bookkeeping lives in :mod:`metronome.validator.state`). This
module owns the single-round statistical verdict and the margin schedule; it
holds no state.
