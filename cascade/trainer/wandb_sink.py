"""Optional Weights & Biases logging for the reference trainer.

cascade already streams per-step training metrics (loss, lr, throughput) to
Hippius S3 as a JSONL blob flushed at the end of each run — durable, but only
visible *after* the ~3h run finishes. This module mirrors the **same** records
into a live wandb run so miners can watch their generator train *as it occurs*.

It is **observability only** — wandb numbers never feed scoring or weights, and
the held-out eval-pool scores are deliberately *not* sent here (that stays the
validator's private, rotating concern; see ``OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`` #6). What lands
in wandb is exactly what already lands in the S3 log: training-corpus metrics.

The integration is best-effort and fully decoupled:

* the ``wandb`` package is a lazy, optional import (the ``[wandb]`` extra); if it
  is missing or ``WANDB_API_KEY`` is unset, logging silently no-ops,
* every wandb call is wrapped so a logging failure can **never** abort a training
  run — the same contract the S3 :class:`~cascade.shared.hippius.LogSink` honours,
* one run is opened per ``(round, competitor, size, stage)`` and tagged with the
  miner hotkey/uid, so a miner filters the (public) wandb project to *their* runs.

Point ``[wandb] project``/``entity`` at a **public** wandb project for miners to
watch; credentials come from the environment (``WANDB_API_KEY``), never
``chain.toml``.
