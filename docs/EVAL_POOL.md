# Building the held-out eval pool

Validators score the king's and challenger's trained models on a **private,
rotating pool of real-world series** (`[eval] window_pool`, a Hippius Hub
`repo@digest`). This doc covers the **producer** side — turning real data into
that pool — with `cascade.pool` and the `cascade-pool` CLI. The consumer side
(fetch ref → slice into windows) lives in `cascade.validator.pool` / `.windows`.

## Why this design is hard to game

The eval is only contamination-resistant if a miner's generator cannot
**distribution-match** the eval set and the trained model cannot **memorise** it.
The pool leans on three levers:

1. **Privacy** — owner-controlled, never published as a named public benchmark.
2. **Freshness** — sources harvest *recent* data up to an `as_of` cutoff; you
   re-build periodically so each pinned pool rotates in time. Data that didn't
   exist at submission can't be matched or memorised. (The validator also rotates
   the *slice* per round via the block hash.)
3. **Breadth** — multiple real domains at sub-daily frequency, so the only way to
   score well is to forecast generally, not to fit one distribution.

Do **not** point the pool at a fixed public benchmark (GIFT-Eval, Monash, …):
those are the easiest thing for a generator to overfit, and they overlap what
time-series foundation models pretrain on.

## Two ways to ship the pool

1. **Daily publish to a bucket (recommended).** The owner orchestrator runs
   `cascade-pool publish` on a cron; validators pull the current snapshot from
   `[storage] pool_bucket` with **no `chain.toml` edit**. This is how the pool
   *rotates in time* — see "Daily rotation & consensus" below.
2. **Static ref.** `cascade-pool build --upload` pins one snapshot's Hub
   `repo@digest` in `[eval] window_pool`. Simple, but refreshing the data means
   editing `chain.toml` + redeploying. Use it for a fixed pool or local testing.

If `[storage] pool_bucket` is set, the validator uses the bucket; otherwise it
falls back to the static ref.

## Quick start

```bash
# Offline smoke test (no network): synthetic series through the full build path.
cascade-pool build --out ./pool --sources synthetic --overwrite

# One-off static pool: build + pin a Hub ref.
cascade-pool build --out ./pool --upload --hub-repo cascade/eval-pool
# → prints  window_pool = "cascade/eval-pool@sha256:…"  ← paste into [eval] in chain.toml

# Daily publish: build + push a snapshot to the pool bucket (no chain.toml edit).
cascade-pool publish --effective-block auto

cascade-pool sources   # list registered sources
```

Window geometry (`context_length` / `horizon`) defaults to `[eval]` in
`chain.toml`, so the pool matches what the validator expects.

## Daily rotation & consensus

`cascade-pool publish` builds a fresh pool, packs it to a deterministic tar,
uploads it to the pool bucket, and appends it to `pool/index.json` stamped with
an **`effective_block`** — the epoch-boundary block from which the snapshot is
active. Each validator, for a round, computes that round's epoch-boundary block
(`created_block` floored to the epoch grid, from the shared manifest) and selects
the snapshot with the greatest `effective_block ≤ that block` — the **same**
deterministic choice on every validator, so two validators that polled at
different times around the daily rollover still score the *identical* pool for a
given round (no latest-wins divergence). Integrity is the tar's sha256, verified
on fetch.

The sha256 lives in `pool/index.json`, which is unsigned — so on its own it
protects against corruption, not against a hostile holder of the bucket's
write credentials. The trainer therefore **pins** the round's snapshot into
the signed manifest (`eval_pool_key` + `eval_pool_sha256`, resolved from the
same pool source its heat screen used): each validator's own snapshot
selection must match the pinned pair or the round is rejected
(`pool_pin_mismatch`), so pool integrity descends from the trainer signature
validators already trust, not from storage ACLs. Unpinned manifests (a
trainer predating the field, or one running without a pool source) keep the
legacy index-trust behaviour. Rollout order matters once: deploy this
validator code everywhere **before** starting a pinning trainer — the pin is
inside the signed body, so older validators would fail signature verification
on pinned manifests. Operationally, never publish a snapshot whose
`effective_block` is at or before an in-flight round's epoch boundary
(`--effective-block auto` already guarantees this): it would flip validators'
selection away from the pinned snapshot mid-round.

> **Why the block, not the round id.** A round id is the epoch-boundary block
> *hash* folded to a 64-bit seed (`ChainClient.block_seed`) — deliberately
> unpredictable, hence non-monotonic. Ordering snapshots by "greatest
> `effective_round ≤ round_id`" over random seeds is meaningless. The epoch
> block *number* is monotonic and every validator derives the same value from
> the manifest's `created_block`, so it is the correct consensus key. (Pool
> index schema v2 made this switch; a v1 index keyed by `effective_round` still
> parses — a redeploy republishes under `effective_block`.)

**Invariant the publisher must hold:** a new snapshot's `effective_block` is in
a *future* epoch (later than the current round). `--effective-block auto` enforces
this by reading the manifest `latest.json` `created_block`, flooring it to the
epoch grid, and adding `--round-buffer` epochs (default 1). Never publish a
snapshot that becomes active for an already-scored round, or validators would
disagree. (`--effective-round` remains as a deprecated alias; its value is now a
block.)

Example daily cron on the orchestrator:

```bash
# 03:00 UTC daily — fresh windows, active from the next round onward.
0 3 * * *  cascade-pool publish --as-of "$(date -u +\%F)" --effective-block auto
```

Validators pick up new snapshots automatically (they re-read the index each
round and fetch a snapshot once, cached by digest). No restart, no `chain.toml`
change.

### Backend: Hippius S3 or Cloudflare R2

The publisher and validators talk to one S3-compatible bucket. Defaults use the
Hippius S3 endpoint + `HIPPIUS_S3_*` credentials. To use R2 instead, set in
`chain.toml`:

```toml
[storage]
pool_bucket      = "cascade-eval-pool"
pool_s3_endpoint = "https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
pool_s3_region   = "auto"
```

and provide `POOL_S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `POOL_S3_SECRET_KEY` (an R2 token). When the
`POOL_S3_*` env is unset, the pool store falls back to the `HIPPIUS_S3_*`
credentials, so a Hippius-only operator needs nothing extra.

## Sources (shipped)

| name            | domain          | freq       | seasonality | notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|-------|
| `openmeteo`     | weather         | H          | 24 (daily)  | keyless archive API; global grid (~252 pts × 12 vars), fills full context |
| `wikimedia`     | web_traffic     | D          | 7 (weekly)  | keyless REST API; ~85 articles, shorter-context breadth |
| `tsbench_forge` | 7 GIFT domains  | 30S–D      | per cadence | reads a synced [tsbench-forge](https://github.com/tensorlink-dev/TSBench-Forge) scraper mirror (~90 feeds, 36 DGP classes); needs the `pool-forge` extra |
| `synthetic`     | synthetic       | H          | 24          | offline/testing only — **not** for a real pool |

### tsbench-forge (bucket relay)

The broadest source is the tsbench-forge live catalog: ~90 verified,
daily-or-faster public feeds across the 7 GIFT-Eval domains, curated with a
contamination denylist and novelty vetting. The coupling is the scraper's
on-disk contract (`sources.yaml` + `data/<source_id>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.parquet`) —
cascade never imports forge code. The deployment is a two-bucket relay:

```
forge scrape host                owner orchestrator                    validators
scraper cron ─► raw-data bucket ─► cascade-pool publish ─► pool bucket ─► fetch by
                (parquet+catalog)  (sync, build, validate)  (tar+index)   effective_block
```

1. The forge repo's scheduled scrape workflow (`.github/workflows/scrape-data.yml`)
   ends with `src/sources/sync_storage.py`: a boto3 mirror of `data/` +
   `sources.yaml` to the **private** Hippius bucket `tsbench-forge-sources`
   (endpoint `https://s3.hippius.com`, credentials `HIPPIUS_S3_ACCESS_KEY` /
   `HIPPIUS_S3_SECRET_KEY`). That bucket is the one canonical raw-data relay;
   the forge repo's `scripts/publish_data_bucket.sh` is only for self-managed
   alternatives and must then target the same bucket the step below syncs.
2. The publish cron here syncs that bucket down and points the source at the
   mirror before building:

```bash
: "${TSFORGE_BUCKET:=tsbench-forge-sources}" "${TSFORGE_S3_ENDPOINT:=https://s3.hippius.com}"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$HIPPIUS_S3_ACCESS_KEY AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$HIPPIUS_S3_SECRET_KEY \
  aws s3 sync "s3://$TSFORGE_BUCKET" ./tsforge --endpoint-url "$TSFORGE_S3_ENDPOINT" --exact-timestamps
TSFORGE_DIR=./tsforge cascade-pool publish --sources tsbench_forge --effective-block auto
```

Only the owner orchestrator holds forge-bucket credentials. Validators never
touch this bucket (or need the forge repo at all) — their sole data dependency
is the built pool snapshot published downstream.

Install the producer extra first: `pip install "cascade[pool-forge]"` (pyarrow
+ pyyaml + pandas; validators never need it — they consume the built `.npy`
pool). Everything downstream — deterministic tar, `effective_block` consensus,
validator fetch — is unchanged.

Properties worth knowing:

* **Freshness cutoff** — only snapshots dated `<= as_of` are read and rows
  stamped after `as_of` are dropped, so a rebuild against the same mirror is
  reproducible (the dated bucket pins the audit inputs).
* **Staleness guard** — a feed whose newest snapshot is older than
  `max_stale_days` (default 4) before `as_of` is skipped; if *every* feed is
  stale the build fails loudly instead of republishing old data. With the crons
  decoupled, a dead scraper must not silently erode the freshness lever.
* **Cluster labels** — every series lands in `metadata.json` with
  `source = <catalog id>`. The validator's KOTH bootstrap resamples these
  *clusters* rather than windows (windows from one feed are correlated), and
  `[scoring] min_clusters` sets a breadth floor on the verdict. Raise it to
  ~30 once this source feeds the pool.
* Weekly-and-slower catalog entries, `disabled` feeds, and categorical feeds
  are skipped; panel-expanded feeds are capped at 200 series per source.

The defaults produce **~3000 raw series** (Open-Meteo's global grid dominates),
which clears `[eval] n_windows = 2000` with margin after validation drops — and
leaves the pool larger than `n_windows`, so each round draws a *different* 2000
slice (intra-day rotation), on top of the daily snapshot rotation.

**Scale the pool by data, not code**: make the Open-Meteo grid denser
(`global_grid(lat_step, lon_step)`), extend `VARIABLES` / `ARTICLES`, or add a
source. One Open-Meteo call per grid point returns all variables, so a denser
grid is the cheapest lever. The CLI warns if the pool falls below
`[scoring] min_windows`. (At ~252 grid points that's ~252 API calls + ~85 for
Wikimedia per daily build — well within the keyless free tiers.)

## Adding a source

Implement the `DataSource` protocol (`cascade/pool/source.py`) — a `name` and
`harvest(fetch, ctx) -> Iterable[HarvestedSeries]` — and register it in
`cascade/pool/sources/__init__.py`. Do **all** network I/O through the injected
`fetch` callable so the source is unit-testable against canned JSON (see
`tests/unit/test_pool_sources.py`). Yield raw series with a pandas-style `freq`;
the builder handles cleaning, gap-fill, length normalisation, degeneracy/dup
filtering, and seasonality.

Good keyless candidates to add: ENTSO-E / EIA grid load (hourly), USGS water
services (hydrology, hourly), air-quality (OpenAQ). Crypto OHLCV is huge and
future-unknowable but near-random-walk, so use it as a minor domain only.

## What the builder guarantees

- **On-disk format** matches `cascade.validator.pool` exactly: one
  `<series_id>.npy` per series (float32; loader upcasts), `metadata.json` keyed by
  `series_id` → `{freq, seasonal_period, domain}`, plus a `provenance.json` the
  loader ignores.
- **Determinism**: same harvested inputs ⇒ byte-identical directory ⇒ the same
  content pushed to the same Hub repo yields the same OCI `repo@digest`. Re-build
  to audit.
- **Cleaning**: gaps interpolated (series dropped above `--max-missing-frac`),
  truncated to the freshest `context_length + horizon` points, short/constant/
  multi-channel series dropped, exact duplicates de-duplicated.
