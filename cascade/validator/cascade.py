"""Cascade — king-reign promotion for the warm-start loop.

The daily king-of-the-hill loop runs underneath: challengers train fresh models
from the shared init and dethrone the king when they clear the margin
(:mod:`cascade.eval.koth` + :mod:`cascade.validator.state`). Cascade sits *on
top* of that loop and answers a different question — *when has one king held the
throne long enough that its best checkpoint should become the new floor the
whole field trains up from?*

The mechanism has three moving parts:

* **Trigger.** A block-anchored *reign clock* counts blocks since the current king
  last took the throne, anchored to the round's epoch-start block (derived
  identically by every validator from the signed manifest's ``created_block`` —
  never local wall-clock, so all validators fire on the SAME round with no skew).
  Every dethrone re-crowns and resets the clock to zero (Cascade reuses the KOTH
  dethrone signal via :meth:`CascadeController.note_dethrone` — it never
  re-implements dethroning). When a king reigns ``cascade_reign_days`` worth of
  blocks (``BLOCKS_PER_DAY`` = 7200 at 12 s/block) undethroned, Cascade fires.

* **Checkpoint selection.** Every checkpoint the king produces during its reign is
  evaluated on the three public suites — GIFT-Eval, BOOM, and TIME — each yielding
  a CRPS and a MASE. The checkpoint is scored ``geomean(gifteval_crps,
  gifteval_mase, boom_crps, boom_mase, time_crps, time_mase)`` (lower is better)
  and the six numbers + score are kept in a per-reign log
  (:class:`CheckpointRecord`). On a Cascade event the reign's lowest-score
  checkpoint is selected — a lookup over the log, never a re-eval.

  The six numbers are produced once by the (trusted, owner-operated) trainer via
  the benchmark sidecar and published on the king's manifest entry
  (:class:`cascade.shared.manifest.BenchScores`), so every validator records the
  *same signed numbers* — Cascade is deterministic across validators rather than
  each re-running a non-bit-reproducible GPU sweep. The validator can still score
  a checkpoint itself as a fallback when the manifest lacks the numbers.

* **Action.** The selected checkpoint is installed as the warm-start init for all
  subsequent rounds (promoted **as-is** — never retrained or fine-tuned). The king
  PERSISTS on the throne — only its reign clock and checkpoint log reset, so the
  next promotion needs a fresh ``cascade_reign_days`` reign. The throne is never
  vacated: both roles train from the shared init, so promotion confers no relative
  advantage to give back, and a vacated throne could only be refilled through a
  dethrone — an incumbent that kept winning would leave it vacant and the clock
  dead forever (DEC-CA-0004).

:class:`CascadeState` (king identity, reign-start block, and the reign's
checkpoint log) is JSON-serialisable and persisted next to the champion state —
Cascade must survive process restarts and pick the clock back up where it left
off. A persisted state predating the block anchor (or missing one) is re-anchored
at the next observed round's block instead of firing immediately, so stale state
can never cause a spurious promotion on restart.

The pure core (the dataclasses + transition functions) carries no I/O and is
unit-tested directly; :class:`CascadeController` binds it to persistence and the
checkpoint installer, and exposes the single per-round entry point
:meth:`CascadeController.cascade_check`.
