"""Trainer service loop — the owner-operated training round.

Each round the trainer:

1. Resolves on-chain generator commitments to ``(hotkey, uid, repo, revision)``.
2. Identifies the reigning king (the highest-incentive UID on the metagraph in
   live mode; a caller-supplied hotkey offline) and selects challengers.
3. For the king and each challenger, under one shared :class:`RoundSeeds`:
   builds the corpus from the generator, trains a fresh base model via the
   owner's :class:`BaseTrainer`, and uploads the checkpoint to HF.
4. Assembles a :class:`TrainingManifest` and (live) publishes it to the
   owner-controlled dataset repo for validators to read.

The pure planning + assembly logic is testable without GPUs or a chain; the
GPU/HF/chain calls are isolated in :meth:`TrainerRunner.train_one` and
:meth:`TrainerRunner.publish`.
