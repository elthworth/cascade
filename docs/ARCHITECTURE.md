# metronome architecture

## The thesis

A time-series foundation model is only as good as the data it was trained on.
metronome makes **synthetic training data** the competitive resource: miners
write data generators, the subnet owner trains **a Toto2-4M backbone from random
initialisation** on each, and the generator whose data yields the best forecaster
wins. By holding the model architecture and the entire training process constant,
the subnet turns a noisy question ("is this model good?") into a controlled one
("is this *data* good?").

Training **from scratch** (not fine-tuning a released checkpoint) is what makes
that attribution clean: a fine-tune confounds data quality with what the
pretrained weights already encode, whereas from random init the corpus is the
*only* source of learned signal. This mirrors Toto 2.0 itself, whose pretraining
mix is 57.5% synthetic and 0% public time series yet still tops GIFT-Eval — the
synthetic prior is the lever, and metronome competes it.

## Roles and data flow

### 1. Miner — submits a generator

A miner writes `generator.py` exposing `Generator(DataGenerator)` and commits a
single on-chain pointer:

```
metro-v1:gen:hf:<org>/<repo>@<40-char-sha>
```

The git SHA pins the generator code, `config.json`, and `requirements.txt`
together. **No model weights** — that is the whole distinction from horizon.
See `docs/INTERFACE.md`.

### 2. Trainer — owner-operated, the GPU boundary

Once per round the trainer:

1. Resolves on-chain commitments to `(hotkey, uid, repo, revision)`.
2. Identifies the reigning **king** (highest-incentive UID on the metagraph) and
   selects **challenger(s)**.
3. Derives one `RoundSeeds` from the round's base seed (the chain block hash):
   a shared `generation_seed` and a shared `training_seed`.
4. For the king and each challenger, **under that one shared seed pair**:
   - materialises the generator repo, runs it in a sandbox, drains a validated
     corpus (`metronome.trainer.corpus`) — a list of `(C, L)` series (univariate
     `C = 1` today; the channel axis is carried so multivariate priors need no
     schema change),
   - trains a **fresh Toto2-4M from random init** via the owner's `BaseTrainer`
     (`metronome.trainer.contract`) for the contract's budget — ~3h on the
     reference GPU, enforced as a fixed `train_tokens` count so king and
     challenger get identical compute,
   - uploads the checkpoint to HF.
5. Publishes a signed `TrainingManifest` listing both trained-model pointers and
   the corpus/contract digests.

`BaseTrainer` is a `Protocol` — the single GPU-dependent seam. Everything else
in the trainer is numpy/CPU and unit-tested. A reference implementation (a
Toto2-4M backbone trained from random init under the `chain.toml [training]`
recipe — `head_dim 64`, `patch_size 32`, a 9-quantile pinball head, u-μP, the
NorMuon+AdamW split) is the operator's to provide; it must be **stateless across
the king and challenger calls** so no information leaks between the two training
runs (shared `training_seed` ⇒ identical random init for both).

### 3. Validator — reads the manifest, decides the throne

The validator never trains. Each round it:

1. Reads the current manifest, verifies its signature and that king and
   challenger share the **contract digest** and **base-arch digest** (the
   controlled-experiment gate — `ValidatorRunner.check_manifest`).
2. Pulls both trained checkpoints and scores them on the **same** held-out
   real-world eval windows (`metronome.validator.evaluator`).
3. Runs the paired-bootstrap KOTH verdict (`metronome.eval.koth.evaluate_round`)
   and folds it into the sticky champion state.
4. Sets winner-take-all weights on the reigning king's UID.

## The controlled-experiment invariant

For a round to be a fair measurement of data quality, the king's model and the
challenger's model must differ in **exactly one** thing: the corpus. metronome
enforces this on three sides:

* **Trainer:** one `RoundSeeds` instance is reused for both — identical *random*
  weight initialisation (`training_seed`, the from-scratch init) and identical
  generation seed.
* **Manifest:** `contract_digest` (sha256 of the `TrainingContractConfig`) and
  `base_arch_digest` are recorded once and asserted equal for both entries.
* **Validator:** rejects any manifest whose digests don't match its own
  `chain.toml`, so a tampered or mismatched training run can't score.

Auditability: because both seeds derive deterministically from the chain block
hash and every corpus carries a `corpus_digest`, a second honest trainer (or a
suspicious validator) can re-draw the corpus and re-train to confirm the run.

## Scoring

Per window, per channel, per model: MASE (Hyndman seasonal-naive denominator) and
the gluonts `MeanWeightedSumQuantileLoss` components `(qloss_per_q, abs_target)`
over the 9-level grid `0.1…0.9`. That grid is *exactly* Toto 2.0's training
objective — its quantile head predicts those nine levels under pinball loss — so
metronome's **score objective equals the model's train objective**, which
collapses the metric-layer gap between what's trained and what's measured.
Univariate windows produce one score each (`channel = 0`); a multivariate window
contributes one row per channel.

The KOTH decision is a **paired bootstrap LCB** on the relative improvement of
`geomean(MWSQL, mean MASE)`, challenger vs king, resampling window indices once
per bag and aggregating MWSQL numerator/denominator before dividing (robust to
near-zero-mean windows). The challenger wins a round iff that LCB clears the
tenure-adjusted win margin on at least `min_windows` common windows. The windows
are a **rotating private slice** (`metronome.validator.windows`): seeded by the
round's block hash so every validator scores the identical set and the king/
challenger comparison is paired, but rotated each round so no fixed eval set can
be distribution-matched.

Dethroning is sticky: `dethrone_cp` consecutive round wins are required; a single
loss or inconclusive round resets the streak. An entrenched king's margin ramps
from `win_margin_start` to `win_margin_end` over `margin_warmup_rounds` of
tenure, so displacing a long-standing king takes a more decisive win.

## Trust model (v1) and the path to decentralisation

v1 centralises training in the owner's trainer and trust in `[manifest]
trainer_hotkey`. This is the pragmatic bootstrap: it makes the controlled
experiment trivially enforceable. The corpus/contract digests already make every
run *reproducible*, which is the hook for decentralising training later (have
validators or a trainer quorum re-derive and challenge a manifest). See
`OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` #1–#2.

## What's implemented vs. a boundary

Implemented and tested (numpy/CPU): the generator contract + output checks (with
the MV-ready `(C, L)` channel axis), the static guard, commit/pointer parsing,
config (the full from-scratch Toto2 contract, digest-pinned), the manifest schema
+ digests, the full scoring + KOTH math, the champion state machine, corpus
building from a generator, the trainer's pairing logic, and the **rotating
private window selection** (`metronome.validator.windows`).

Boundaries left for the integrator (clearly marked TODO): the **Toto2-4M
from-scratch `BaseTrainer`** (the GPU seam), the corpus sandbox subprocess, the
private eval-**pool loader** (the rotating *selection* is implemented; pulling and
slicing the held-out corpus into the pool is the boundary), manifest
signing/verification, and the two live service loops (`trainer/main.py`,
`validator/main.py`).
