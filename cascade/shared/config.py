    The central invariant of cascade: the only thing that varies between the
    two trained models is the generator's data. Every field here is held
    constant across the pair (and folded into ``contract_digest``) so the eval
    is a controlled measurement of data quality.

    cascade trains a **Toto2 backbone from random initialisation** on each
    generator's corpus — it does *not* fine-tune a released checkpoint. Training
    from scratch is what makes the corpus the only source of learned signal: a
    fine-tune would confound "good data" with "what the pretrained weights
    already knew". Because the run starts from noise, the contract has to pin
    the *entire* recipe — architecture, objective, masking, optimiser, and the
    compute budget — not just three hyperparameters. ``base_arch_digest`` is the
    sha256 of the frozen architecture + initialisation code; set it before
    launch so a trainer can't silently swap models between rounds.

    The architecture defaults below track Datadog's released ``Toto-2.0-4m``
    (arch family fixes ``head_dim = 64``; Toto 2.0 uses ``patch_size = 32`` and
    a 9-quantile pinball head). Pin the exact integers to that checkpoint's
    ``config.json`` before launch, same convention as ``base_arch_digest``.

    Budget is expressed as **wall-clock hours on the owner's reference GPU**
    (``target_train_hours``, e.g. 3) but *enforced* as a fixed token count —
    ``target_train_hours × 3600 × ref_throughput_tokens_per_s`` (the
    ``train_tokens`` property). Going through a pinned token count rather than a
    raw timer matters: both king and challenger then see **identical compute**
    regardless of data-dependent throughput (a pure timer would let a generator
    win by emitting cheap-to-step data rather than better data), and a re-derived
    audit run reproduces the same step count. ``max_train_seconds`` is the hard
    wall-clock guard. Budgeting by compute (not epochs) also keeps a tiny corpus
    from winning by being trivially memorised in a few passes.
