"""Trainer-side submission queue with cheap anti-duplicate checks.

metronome trains the king and a challenger together under one shared
:class:`~metronome.trainer.contract.RoundSeeds` — a single round is the
expensive resource (~3h of GPU per generator). This module sits in front of that
expense as a FIFO backlog of *challenger* generators discovered on-chain, with a
handful of O(1)/O(n) checks that keep guaranteed-wasted runs off the GPU. It is
the metronome analogue of teutonic's validator queue (FIFO drain + copy gate),
adapted to metronome's content-addressed submissions.

The headline check is **duplicate-of-king**: because a generator is pinned by its
immutable Hub ``repo@digest``, a challenger whose generator is byte-identical to
the reigning king's (same ref) would burn a full controlled-experiment round on a
generator that can only tie the king (a challenger must clear the win margin to
dethrone — an identical run never will), so it is dropped for free with a ref
equality test, never fetched, never run.

Three more cheap checks ride along at :meth:`SubmissionQueue.enqueue`:

* **already-queued** — the same ref is already waiting (idempotent re-discovery
  of an unchanged commitment across polls).
* **already-trained** — the ref was already trained *this reign*. The cache
  resets when the king changes (:meth:`note_king`), mirroring teutonic's
  per-cycle ``evaluated_repos``: under single-round dethroning (the shipped
  ``[scoring] dethrone_cp = 1``) a challenger that has had its one fair shot
  against the current king should not be re-trained every round until the throne
  turns over.
* **latest-commit-wins** — a new ref from a hotkey already in the queue
  supersedes that hotkey's older queued entry (miners re-deploy by committing a
  new ref), matching :func:`metronome.trainer.loop.resolve_commitments`.

The queue is a small JSON-serialisable record so the trainer can persist it to
``[queue] state_db_path`` and keep the backlog (and per-reign dedup) across
restarts, the same way the validator persists its champion state.
