"""Keep cascade's own loggers visible alongside bittensor.

bittensor's logging machine, on import, silences every *other* logger by setting
it to ``CRITICAL`` (it keeps only bittensor's own output). That swallows all
``cascade.*`` ``INFO``/``WARNING``/``ERROR`` messages from the trainer and
validator services, which makes them look hung when they are working fine.

:func:`restore_cascade_logging` imports bittensor (forcing that one-time silence
to happen now) and then puts the ``cascade.*`` loggers back at the requested
level. Call it once in a service ``main`` before entering the run loop.
