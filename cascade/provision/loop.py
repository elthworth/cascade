"""The cascade-provisioner service loop — rent per round, tear down per stage.

One cycle of the machine (each ``poll_seconds``, ~30s):

    WAIT   poll the chain block until :func:`policy.should_trigger` fires
           (inside the last ``trigger_margin_blocks`` of the epoch, once per
           round — that is when timed reveals have landed and the field is
           countable);
    COUNT  ask the trainer for the round plan (``plan_fn``; real impl runs
           ``cascade-trainer --plan-only`` and parses its JSON line);
    SIZE   :func:`policy.size_fleet` — slot-based heat fleet off the eligible
           field, one multi-GPU final pod for king + finalists; with
           ``final_rent_on = "heat_complete"`` the final is NOT rented here —
           it defers to the trainer's heat_complete marker (sized off the
           marker's ACTUAL finalist list) unless the pinned SKU's primary
           rung probes scarce at the margin, the early-rental exception
           (see ``_maybe_rent_final_jit`` / ``_final_primary_has_capacity``);
    RENT   in a WORKER THREAD (the loop keeps ticking — boot waits must never
           starve teardown/heartbeat/reconcile, the 2026-07-14 lesson): the
           stage's SKU ladder × provider priority order, with escalation — a
           rung that delivers NO healthy pod (failed launch, or every pod
           and its replacement a dud) falls to the next (candidate × provider)
           rung under a per-attempt deadline, and a fleet below viability gets
           one same-candidate top-up (see ``_rent_stage_escalating``); every
           pod is named/tagged ``cascade-{round_id}-…`` so reconcile can find
           strays;
    BOOT   provider-ready → SSH reachable → the seven-check health gate; a
           failed pod is terminated and replaced ONCE, then dropped;
    PUBLISH atomically write hosts.toml (heat + final entries) — the trainer
           picks it up at round start (``--hosts-wait-seconds`` covers boot);
    RETRY  a stage that rented NOTHING re-enters pick→budget→rent every
           ``rent_retry_cooldown_s`` while enough of the round remains for
           it to matter (the orchestrator is CPU-only — an un-retried failed
           rental is a lost round, not a degraded one); the rent-once latch
           still guards plan_fn and the poll cadence (``_maybe_retry_stages``);
    WATCH  the two teardown signals: the trainer's ``heat_complete.json``
           marker under the shared work-root, and the round manifest in the
           store;
    TEARDOWN per stage — heat pods die on the marker while the final still
           runs (hosts.toml is re-rendered final-only); final pods die on the
           manifest; the TTL (one epoch from rent) is the hard backstop; and
    RECONCILE every cycle: live pods tagged ``cascade-`` that the ledger does
           not own are terminated (a crash between launch and ledger-save must
           not leak a billing box).

The optional EVAL stage rides the opposite phase of the same machine: renting
is triggered by a NEW round manifest appearing in the store (that is when the
validator's heavy evals — GIFT-Eval gate, cascade bench — start needing GPU),
the pod is published to a SEPARATE ``eval_hosts_path`` file that the validator
re-reads lazily per eval (never the trainer's ``hosts_path``), and teardown
comes from the round's receipt publishing under ``receipt_prefix`` (the
validator is done), a newer manifest superseding the round, or the same TTL
backstop. ``last_evaled_round`` persists in the ledger so restarts never
double-rent. See ``_maybe_provision_eval``.

Round-id note: the provisioner keys rounds by the upcoming BOUNDARY BLOCK
(knowable before the round starts), while the trainer keys them by base_seed
(the boundary block's hash — knowable only after). The two are reconciled at
the marker: any ``heat_complete.json`` under the work-root NEWER than our rent
time is this round's (only one round runs at a time), and its directory name
IS the base_seed, which then lets us poll ``manifests/round-<base_seed>.json``
directly. Until a marker appears we also watch ``latest.json`` for a round_id
change since rent — either signal ends the round.

Every boundary is injected (chain client, plan_fn, providers, manifest store,
health check, ssh probe, clock, sleep), so the whole cycle is unit-tested with
fakes; the loop itself is thin glue over ``policy``/``state``/``health``.

        2. A stage that comes up EMPTY — the launch call failed, or every pod
           AND its replacement was a dud — re-enters the offer ladder at the
           next (candidate × provider) rung: capacity is probed at escalation
           time (the iterator is lazy) and each new rung is re-checked against
           the round budget with the other stages' current offers
           (:meth:`_escalation_budget_ok`); an over-cap rung is skipped, not
           fatal — a cheaper one may sit further down.
        3. A stage that comes up PARTIAL below ``min_viable_fleet`` of its
           slot demand gets ONE same-candidate top-up batch
           (:meth:`_maybe_top_up`) — never a different SKU, so the

        Everything is bounded by a wall-clock deadline (``escalate_deadline_s``
        from this attempt's start), not an attempt count. Renting runs in a
        worker thread, so the deadline no longer protects loop liveness; what
        it bounds now is ONE attempt's lifetime: only one rent worker runs at
        a time, so a wedged attempt would block the JIT final, the cooldown
        retries, and — worst — the NEXT round's margin trigger. Ending the
        attempt hands control to the retry machinery, which re-probes the
        whole market fresh and paces itself with dud-aware backoff. Deadline
        or ladder exhausted ⇒ the stage degrades for this attempt — fewer
