When a heat/final rental fails, the provisioner escalates by three rules,
cheapest signal first (`ProvisionerLoop._rent_stage_escalating`):

1. a dud pod gets ONE same-rung replacement, its machine excluded;
2. a stage that comes up EMPTY (failed launch, or every pod + replacement a
   dud) re-enters the SKU ladder at the next (candidate × provider) rung —
   capacity re-probed at escalation time, each rung re-checked against the
   round budget;
3. a stage PARTIAL below `min_viable_fleet` (0.5) of its slot demand gets ONE
   same-candidate top-up batch — never a different SKU, preserving the
   stage-never-mixes-candidates fairness invariant.

4. a stage that rented NOTHING re-attempts the full pick→budget→rent
   pipeline every `rent_retry_cooldown_s` (15 min) for as long as the stage
   can still matter: the heat while one serial screening wave fits its
   remaining window (the fleet re-sizes to that window), the final while
   full duel hours + boot margin remain (`_maybe_retry_stages`). Probe-only
   failures retry at the flat cadence all round; attempts that LAUNCHED only
   duds double the stage's cooldown per attempt (capped 8×), and
   `max_duds_per_stage` (8) stops renting for the round when a market keeps
   selling broken pods — duds bill minutes the budget breaker cannot see;
5. the FINAL fleet is stage-phased (`final_rent_on = "heat_complete"` on
   mainnet): rented just-in-time at the trainer's `heat_complete.json`
   marker, sized off the marker's ACTUAL finalist list — unless the primary
   L40S rung probes scarce at the margin, in which case early rental is the
   exception that locks capacity (`_maybe_rent_final_jit`). The trainer
   re-reads hosts before the duel (`_reload_remote_hosts(require_stage=
   "final")`, waiting `--hosts-wait-seconds`), so JIT pods land inside its
   patience.

Renting runs in a WORKER THREAD (one at a time), the discipline the eval
stage earned after 2026-07-14: boot waits and ladder escalation never starve
teardown/heartbeat/reconcile ticks. Consequences: the orphan reaper skips
its tick while a rent worker runs (a worker may own pods it has not
ledgered yet), ledger mutations are lock-guarded across the two threads,
and a manifest publishing mid-rent aborts the worker (its ledgered pods die
in the next sweep, the publish is skipped). `escalate_deadline_s` (30 min)
now bounds ONE attempt — not loop liveness — so the single worker never
starves the JIT final, the retries, or the next round's trigger. Degrading
is still never acceptable: the orchestrator is CPU-only, so trainer-local
training is effectively a lost round, and a locally-trained final can never
pass the validator's `expected_gpu` pin regardless — hence rule 4's
persistence. The rent-once latch still guards `plan_fn` and the 30s poll
cadence. The eval stage deliberately does not escalate (one pod; the
validator's local CPU evals are genuinely viable), and eval rents now
respect the round's committed heat/final spend (one-way budget coupling).

Same decision, config side: the heat ladder's floor is 2× pods — no 1× rungs.
A single-GPU pod pays the full bootstrap cost (rsync + `uv sync`) for one
lane, and a singles fleet burns the whole `max_pods` cap on flaky boxes.
