"""Pure fleet policy for the per-round provisioner — sizing, triggering, budget.

Everything here is arithmetic over plain data: no clock, no chain, no provider
API. The service loop (``cascade.provision.loop``) feeds these functions the
observed world (current block, the trainer's ``--plan-only`` field count, live
offer prices) and acts on the returned plan; keeping the decisions pure makes
every sizing/teardown/budget rule unit-testable without a cloud account.

The shape of the problem: a round is one ``epoch_blocks`` window. Shortly
before the boundary (once timed reveals have landed and the field is countable)
the provisioner rents two fleets —

* a **heat** fleet of cheap-SKU pods that screen-trains the whole eligible
  field at ``heat_train_hours`` each, sized so the heat finishes in time for
  the final; and
* a **final** fleet on the pinned SKU where the king and each finalist train
  the full budget. The default shape is ONE multi-GPU pod: the validator's
  ``expected_gpu`` pairing is trivially satisfied when every final run reports
  the same physical machine's GPU, and a single box removes cross-pod variance.

Both fleets are bounded by ``max_pods`` per stage and by a hard
``max_spend_per_round`` circuit breaker computed at worst case (every pod
billed for the full TTL) — a runaway round can cost at most that number.
