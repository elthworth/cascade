"""DataGenerator — the miner-facing contract.

Every submitted generator must subclass :class:`DataGenerator`. The generator
is the adapter between the trainer's standard corpus-building protocol and
whatever arbitrary synthetic-data process the miner has designed.

The contract is intentionally narrow:

* construction takes the local repo directory and a deterministic ``seed``
* ``generate(n_series)`` yields exactly ``n_series`` univariate float series
* output is bounded: per-series length in ``[min_length, max_length]`` and a
  global cap on total emitted points, both enforced by the trainer

Determinism is load-bearing. The trainer seeds every generator from the chain
block hash at the training round's start, so two honest trainers (or a
validator re-running the trainer to audit) draw the *same* corpus. A generator
whose output depends on wall-clock, process entropy, or un-seeded RNG breaks
auditability and is rejected by the determinism check in
``cascade verify``.

The on-chain submission is a single pointer string
``metro-v1:gen:hippius:<repo>@<digest>``; the Hippius Hub ``repo@digest``
references the full repo tree — generator code, ``config.json``, and
``requirements.txt`` — together (the OCI digest *is* the content hash, so it
pins them).
A generator is **code-only** (purely algorithmic): it must NOT ship learned
weights of any kind, so the competition is on the data-generating prior, not on
a large pretrained forecaster distilled into a "generator". ``torch``/``gpytorch``
are available as compute libraries for GP/kernel priors. Determinism still
applies — seed every framework RNG (NumPy and, if used, ``torch.manual_seed`` +
``torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)``) so the corpus stays reproducible.
