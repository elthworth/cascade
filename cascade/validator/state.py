"""Champion state and the sticky dethrone machine.

The per-round statistical verdict lives in :mod:`cascade.eval.koth`; this
module owns the *stateful* part: a challenger must win ``dethrone_cp``
**consecutive** rounds before it takes the throne (``dethrone_cp = 1`` makes
dethroning single-round). A single lost or inconclusive round resets its streak.
The king's ``tenure_rounds`` feeds the margin schedule (when warmup is enabled,
an entrenched king is harder to displace). Dethroned kings are remembered in
``former_kings`` so reward routing can split weight across the recent court of
champions (teutonic-style payout).

State is a small, JSON-serialisable record so it can be persisted to the
validator's state DB (``[validator] state_db_path``) and survive restarts.
