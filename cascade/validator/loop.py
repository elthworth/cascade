"""Validator loop — manifest → eval → KOTH decision → weights.

The validator never trains. Each round it:

1. Reads the current :class:`TrainingManifest` from the owner dataset repo and
   verifies its signature + that king and challenger share the contract digest
   (the controlled-experiment guarantee).
2. Pulls the king's and challenger's trained checkpoints and scores both on the
   *same* held-out eval windows.
3. Runs the paired-bootstrap KOTH verdict and folds it into the sticky
   champion state (``dethrone_cp`` consecutive wins to take the throne;
   ``dethrone_cp = 1`` makes it single-round).
4. Sets weights: equal share across the current king plus up to
   ``[scoring] reward_prior_kings`` registered prior kings (teutonic-style),
   collapsing to winner-take-all when ``reward_prior_kings = 0``.

The pure orchestration in :meth:`ValidatorRunner.process_round` is testable by
injecting ``evaluate_fn`` and ``windows``; HF + torch + chain are isolated
behind the defaults.
