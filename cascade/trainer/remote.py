"""Remote training dispatch — run king and challenger on separate GPU boxes.

The trainer can run a round's two (or more) trainings on separate rented GPU pods
(Lium, Targon, or any SSH-reachable host) **in parallel**, instead of
sequentially on one local device. Because the compute budget is a fixed
``train_tokens`` count (not wall-clock), splitting across devices keeps king and
challenger on *identical compute*; only byte-exact re-derivation relaxes to
tolerance — rented marketplace hardware varies (see ``chain.toml`` corpus_mode).

Design: the remote unit is a **round-worker**, not a remote ``BaseTrainer``. Each
pod pulls its generator from the Hippius Hub registry by ref, builds the corpus in
its own sandbox, trains, uploads the checkpoint to the registry, and prints a
``TrainedEntry`` receipt (``cascade.trainer.worker``). The orchestrator (which
holds the wallet) collects the receipts and signs + publishes the manifest
locally — **the trainer hotkey never lands on a rented box**. A pod needs
cascade + torch + a GPU + registry/S3 access (seed its env once when you rent
it), not the wallet.

Hosts live in a **trainer-local** file (NOT ``chain.toml`` — that file is public
and shared with miners/validators). Transport is the system ``ssh`` client, so
there is no extra dependency. The command-construction and receipt-parsing
helpers are pure and unit-tested; only :func:`dispatch_train` shells out.
