"""Trainer service loop — the owner-operated training round.

Each round the trainer:

1. Resolves on-chain generator commitments to ``(hotkey, uid, ref)``.
2. Identifies the reigning king (the highest-incentive UID on the metagraph in
   live mode; a caller-supplied hotkey offline) and selects challengers.
3. For the king and each challenger, under one shared :class:`RoundSeeds`:
   fetches the generator from the Hippius Hub registry by ref, builds the corpus,
   trains a fresh base model via the owner's :class:`BaseTrainer` (streaming
   per-step metrics to Hippius S3), and uploads the checkpoint to the registry.
4. Assembles a :class:`TrainingManifest`, signs it with the trainer hotkey, and
   (live) publishes it to the Hippius S3 manifest bucket for validators.

The pure planning + assembly logic is testable without GPUs, a chain, or
Hippius; the GPU / registry / S3 / chain calls are isolated in
:meth:`TrainerRunner.train_one`, :meth:`TrainerRunner.publish`, and the live
:meth:`TrainerRunner.run_forever`.
